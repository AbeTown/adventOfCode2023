    "- making the translation table would be just as bad wouldn't it? Yes... it would... if you actually wrote it all out.\n",
    "- Instead, you can just modify somehow so that you look at how each mapper would apply to each range of seeds. You should only have to check each mapping range one time. so if mapper one has 3 ranges, you loop those 3 ranges and ask which one is going to return the smallest number for the given seed input range... But you can't know the final range can you?\n",
    "- So now we are examining the combination of filters to see which input ranges give the smallest return values... so starting at the end, 0, or 1 maybe, are the smallest return values. How do you get 0 or 1? working backwards from there should give you a starting number that would give 0. the question is how to translate that into a range...\n",
    "- the 7 filters and their various mappers can probably be turned into... idk lets just say 30 straight through converters. And then anything that's not captured by a converter gets passed straight through as itself. so you've got:\n",

    "- for each of those, we want to look at our next filter table. Lets say it has nothing 50-60, +3 61-80, and -40 81-105. that would look like: {(61,80):(64,84), (81,103):(41,63)}\n",
    "- so we take the output range of our first table and compare to input range of second table. in this case, we get that {(52,60):(52,60),(61,80):(64,84),(81,99):(41,59)}\n",
    "- then we have to translate that back to our original inputs, which, while we're at it, should have included an open ended range... {(?,49):(?,49),(50,58):(52,60),(59,78):(64:84),(79,97):(41,59),(98,?):NOPE this gets split up.,(98,105):(58:65),(105,?):(105:?)}\n",
